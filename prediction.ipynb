      "Review: It’s a drag to feel you’re being held hostage by someone else’s nostalgia. The stage show Wicked is beloved by many; it’s been playing on Broadway for 20 years and counting, which means a lot of little girls, and others, have happily fallen under the poppy-induced spell of Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz’s musical about the complex origins of the not-really-so-bad Wicked Witch of the West. Legions of kids and grownups have hummed and toe-tapped along with numbers like “Popular” and “Defying Gravity,” one a twinkly sendup of what it takes to be the most-liked girl at school, the other a peppy empowerment ballad about charting your own course in life. The film adaptation of Wicked—directed by John M. Chu and starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande—will increase the material’s reach, giving many more people the chance to fall in love with it. Or not.\n",

But if you fail to feel the transformative magic of Chu’s Wicked, there are some good reasons: The movie is so aggressively colorful, so manic in its insistence that it’s OK to be different, that it practically mows you down. And this is only part one of the saga—the second installment arrives in November 2025. Wicked pulls off a distinctive but dismal magic trick: it turns other people’s cherished Broadway memories into a protracted form of punishment for the rest of us.\n",

      "Wicked the movie is cobbled together from many complex moving parts, and some of them work better than others. Grande plays Glinda, the good witch of Oz—but is she really all that good? The backstory that will consume all two hours and 41 minutes of this movie—roughly the same amount of time as the stage musical, though again, this is only the first half—proves the almost-opposite. This is really the story of Elphaba, played by Erivo, who is, at the movie’s onset, a reticent young woman with dazzling supernatural powers. The problem is that she has green skin, which makes her a target for mockery and derision, an outcast. Elphaba is a reimagining of the character first brought to life by L. Frank Baum in his extraordinary and wonderfully weird turn-of-the-century Oz books, and later portrayed in the revered 1939 Wizard of Oz by Margaret Hamilton. Wicked—whose source material, roughly speaking, is Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West—is built around the idea that Elphaba wasn’t born bad, but was merely forced into making decisions that set her on a path different from that of the insufferable goody-two-shoes Glinda, her enemy turned frenemy turned friend. The story’s subtext—or, rather, its glaring bold type—is that we’re all shaped by our choices, which are at least partly determined by our response to how others treat us.\n",

But as Elphaba goes about the business of getting her younger sister settled at Shiz, her fantastical powers—they flow from her like electricity, especially when she’s angry or frustrated—catch the attention of the school’s superstar professor, the chilly, elegant Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh).

But there’s always an undercurrent of competitiveness there—Glinda isn’t half as gifted as Elphaba is, and she's the opposite of down-to-earth. Grande has some fun with Glinda’s sugary, over-the-top manipulations: she has the fluttery eyelids of a blinking doll and the twirly elegance of a music-box ballerina.

    "# '''When it's all about the spectacle of big, splashy production numbers, this prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz\" is thrilling, whether we're in Munchkinland, the Emerald City or the campus of Shiz University, where a young Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North first cross paths. As we've seen from the director's previous films including \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"In the Heights,\" Chu is uniquely adept at presenting an enormous song-and-dance extravaganza without getting lost in it. His sense of pacing and perspective draw us in and center us within the swirling fantasy. It helps greatly that he has deeply talented stars in Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande: magnetic multi-hyphenates who can meet every physical and emotional challenge of these iconic characters. Following in the footsteps of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth would seem like a daunting task, but Erivo and Grande bring their own vocal power and dramatic interpretation to the roles of Elphaba and Glinda, respectively. You truly feel the friendship between these opposites, particularly in one beautiful, wordless dance sequence where they forge their unlikely bond, which is moving in its understatement. That's the foundation of this story, so it's crucial that we know their connection is true for its destruction to be meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Far less effective is the way Chu, working from a script by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, wedges in the movie's heavier themes of authoritarianism. Yes, they are baked into the story: We know from watching 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz\" countless times that the wizard is a con artist who rules by fear. His deception is literally one of smoke and mirrors. That's all in the source material of the \"Wicked\" stage production, as well, for which Holzman wrote the book and Stephen Schwartz wrote the music and lyrics. Here, in film form, the tone swings awkwardly between upbeat wonder and dark oppression. This is a world in which minorities are hunted, placed in cages and prevented from speaking, where a charismatic leader (a playfully evil Jeff Goldblum) persecutes a woman of color. It is not subtle, and it feels all-too relevant to our times, despite originating decades ago. It also drags down the energy of this epic tale. And yet, overstuffed as the film is at 2 hours and 40 minutes, this is only part one: \"Wicked\" ends where the intermission occurs in the stage show, with part two coming in November 2025. It's a lot to ask of an audience. Still, people who love this story and these characters will be delighted, and there's much here for people who aren't familiar with the musical but are looking for a cinematic escape around the holidays. \n",
    "\n",
    "# \"Wicked\" begins with Grande's Glinda descending majestically into Munchkinland to inform her enthusiastic fans that the rumors are true: The witch really is dead. Then it flashes back to how she and the green-hued Elphaba (the Wicked Witch's first name) became unlikely allies in college. Elphaba has always been bullied and ostracized because of the color of her skin; Glinda—or Galinda, as she's known at this point—is a pretty, pampered mean girl who's always gotten her way. (Bowen Yang is a hoot as one of her loyal sycophants.) \n",
    "\n",
    "# But once they're forced to room together, they eventually realize, to their surprise, that they genuinely see each other in a way no one ever has before. Galinda's makeover anthem \"Popular\"—one of the most popular songs from the show—is among the film's highlights, and a great example of the technical prowess \"Wicked\" offers. The costume design from Paul Tazewell (\"West Side Story\") and production design from longtime Christopher Nolan collaborator Nathan Crowley are exquisite throughout but especially here. Alice Brooks' cinematography is consistently wondrous, but her use of hot pink lighting as Galinda's at the height of her power is really evocative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Chu's usual choreographer, Christopher Scott, delivers again with vibrant, inspired moves, particularly in the elaborate \"Dancing Through Life,\" which takes place in the school's rotating, multilevel library. \"Bridgerton\" star Jonathan Bailey gets a chance to show off his musical theater background here, and he's terrifically charming as the glib Prince Fiyero, the object of both Elphaba and Galinda's romantic interests. Michelle Yeoh brings elegance and just a hint of danger to her role as Madame Morrible, the university's sorcery professor. And Peter Dinklage lends gravitas as the resonant voice of Dr. Dillamond, a goat instructor who, like other talking animals in Oz, finds himself increasingly in peril. \n",
    "\n",
    "# But it's that connection between Erivo and Grande that gives the film its emotional heft. Erivo does do much with her eyes to convey Elphaba's sadness and loneliness and, eventually, her hope and determination. There's a directness about her screen presence that's immediate and engaging, and of course she can sing the hell out of these demanding songs. Grande meets her note for note and once again displays her comic chops, but it's the little choices that make her portrayal of the perfect Galinda feel human: a jerky perkiness that's slightly dorky. The blonde tresses and array of pink dresses scream confidence, but deep down she's a try-hard whose desire to be liked is her driving motivation. \n",
    "\n",
    "# As undeniably crowd-pleasing as \"Wicked\" is in its big moments, these smaller and more intimate details are just as magical. '''\n",
